# N-Queens-using-genetic-algorithm

## Description

This program uses the Python3 programming language to implement the N-Queens problem using genetic algorithms.<br>
The code is developed using a modular programming methodology, that is, this code uses functions and methods that implement the main
genetic operators.<br><br>
The objective of this implementation is to be able to create a library of functions and/or methods that can be reused in any other program that can be implemented in the future with the corresponding savings in time and lines of code.<br><br>
This code has the following functions:<br>
<li>Random float generator for numbers between 0 and 1</li><br>
<li>Random int generator for numbers between N and M</li><br>
<li>Input size of population</li><br>
<li>Calculate fitness</li><br>
<li>Roulette wheel metod</li><br>
<li>Reproduce two chromosomes</li><br>
<li>Mute one chromosome</li><br>
<li>Compare the old generation with her childs to generate a new generation</li><br>

## Usage

Clone this repository and in the project folder run the terminal and type the command python `python main.py`.<br>
This repository was tested with `python@3.10.5`.

# N-Queens-using-genetic-algorithm

## Description

This program use the Python3 programming language that implements the N-Queens problem using genetic algorithms.<br>
The code is developed using a modular programming methodology, that is, this code use functions and methods that implement the main
genetic operators which is used in the main program.<br>
The objective of this implementation is to be able to create a library of functions and/or methods that can be re-used in any other program that can be implemented in the future with the corresponding savings in time and lines of code.<br>
This code have:<br>
<li>Random float generator for numbers between 0 and 1</li><br>
<li>Random int generator for numbers between N and M</li><br>

## Usage

Clone this repository and in the project folder run the terminal and type the command python `python main.py`.<br>
This repository was tested with `python@3.10.5`.

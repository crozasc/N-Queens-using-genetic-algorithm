# N-Queens-using-genetic-algorithm

## Description

Develop a program using the Python3 programming language that implements the N-Queens problem using genetic algorithms.<br>
The code must be developed using a modular programming methodology, that is, there must be use of functions and/or methods that generically implement the main
genetic operators which will be used in the main program.<br>
The objective of this implementation is to be able to create a library of functions and/or methods that can be re-used in any other program that can be implemented in the future with the corresponding savings in time and lines of code.

## Usage

Clone this repository and in the project folder run the terminal and type the command python `python main.py`.<br>
This repository was tested with `python@3.10.5`.
